<h4><b>
Cost of Living Support
</h4></b><br><br><h6>
The cost of living is making life very tough right now. We don't want anyone to miss out on ResBaz because of financial concerns, so we aim to offer a free ticket if you are worried about the cost of attending ResBaz. <br><br>

We're are offering free registration to volunteers and those that need it, so get in touch <a href=" mailto:resbaz@qcif.edu.au " target="_blank">resbaz@qcif.edu.au</a> if you're keen to help out. <br><br></h6>
