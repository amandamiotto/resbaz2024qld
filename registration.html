<h4><b>
Accessibility bursaries available
</h4></b><br><br><h6>
The cost of living is making life very tough right now. We don't want anyone to miss out on ResBaz because of financial concerns, so we aim to offer support if you are worried about the cost of attending ResBaz. <br><br>

If you have concerns about childcare, travel or other accessibility expenses, please contact us at <a href=" mailto:resbaz@qcif.edu.au " target="_blank">resbaz@qcif.edu.au</a> to ask about our Accessibility Bursaries. We're also offering free registration to volunteers, so get in touch <a href=" mailto:resbaz@qcif.edu.au " target="_blank">resbaz@qcif.edu.au</a> if you're keen to help out. <br><br></h6>
