  title: "Hopefully good and some definitively bad advice for researchers in the digital AI age"
  description: "Researchers are expected to know their field inside out and be on top of the application domains the research they are doing can benefit. 
This requirement can be a challenging endeavour at the best of times, but has become extraordinarily chaotic in light of the pace of recent developments 
in the digital domain, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and their increasingly wide reaching consequences. How is our way of doing 
research being disrupted, both positively and negatively? Are the things we’re researching even relevant anymore, given the rapid change in the 
application domains where that research might be used? Questions like these can make even the most self-assured researcher doubt their path forwards. A 
sensible action to take in such circumstances is to ask experienced peers for advice, but what was “sensible” and valid advice even five years ago isn’t 
necessarily good advice today. In my talk, I’ll present insights and advice, both good and bad, for how to successfully navigate current changes, drawing 
upon my experiences advising industry, government and research sectors."
