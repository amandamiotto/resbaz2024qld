  title: "Hopefully good and some definitively bad advice for researchers in the digital AI age"
  description: "Researchers are expected to know their field inside out and be on top of the application domains the research they are doing can benefit. 
This requirement can be a challenging endeavour at the best of times, but has become extraordinarily chaotic in light of the pace of recent developments 
in the digital domain, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and their increasingly wide reaching consequences. How is our way of doing 
research being disrupted, both positively and negatively? Are the things we’re researching even relevant anymore, given the rapid change in the 
application domains where that research might be used? Questions like these can make even the most self-assured researcher doubt their path forwards. A 
sensible action to take in such circumstances is to ask experienced peers for advice, but what was “sensible” and valid advice even five years ago isn’t 
necessarily good advice today. In my talk, I’ll present insights and advice, both good and bad, for how to successfully navigate current changes, drawing 
upon my experiences advising industry, government and research sectors."

  title: "Online science communication: an evidence-based guide on how to get started"
  subtype: talk
  speakers: [6]
  description: "Video-based learning is built upon Mayer’s multimedia theory of learning, which emphasises the value of flexible 
communication skills to lower the burden of cognitive load for diverse audiences.  Online multimedia can be leveraged for science communication, but the 
production of high-quality online resources has significant resource implications.  This project evaluated large undergraduate 
science courses that embedded over 100 hours of video content from 2020-2022 to determine best-practice guidelines for producing effective online 
multimedia.  Participant survey and interview results revealed broad agreement with the value of 
segmenting information, presenter presence, and mixed perspectives in science videos.  However individual student preferences varied on the extent of presenters’ on-screen visibility, use of graphics, and subtitling.  Video 
analytics revealed a decrease in viewer retention as each video progresses, but this rate of decline can be slowed through on-screen text, animations, 
and camera angle changes. Together this data provides an evidence-based framework for designing science videos that will engage different online 
audiences and disseminate your research."

  description: "There are many reasons a researcher should think about the commercialisation of their research, from tangibly solving the world's biggest 
problems, to creating more industry engagement and increasing funding opportunities in the future. Join Rachel in this session to discover the many 
reasons why research commercialisation matters, and explore the pathways to commercialise research. This is basically a crash course in research 
commercialisation mixed with a dash of personal reflections from Rachel’s entrepreneurship and research commercialisation experience so far. The goal of 
this session is for you to walk away feeling inspired and encouraged and hopefully thinking about how your research can be commercialised."

  subtype: talk
  speakers: [3]
  description: "Digital research infrastructure has become paramount for the advancement of all scientific research and innovation. We explore the 
fundamental shifts requiring greater coordination and connections across the entire data lifecycle (technology and processes) within and between research 
organisations. We will highlight the importance of enhancing digital skills across the research workforce and raise awareness of the national research 
infrastructures to effectively develop and manage connections in Australia."
