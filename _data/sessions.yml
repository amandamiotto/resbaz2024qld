    In the first semester of 2023, the Australian Text Analytics Program (with support from The University of Queensland Graduate School) ran a Graduate Digital Research Fellowship program. The program was open to post-graduate students based in SE Qld; of the four participants, three were from UQ and one was from Griffith. The application process encouraged potential fellows to think of projects which were related to but not directly part of their main research project and which would require them to develop skills in digital research methods. One of the participants also carried out a placement with AARNet under a UQ program for HDR students.

    This session will be a panel discussion including the two leaders of the program, our AARNet colleague, and the four fellows, discussing issues including (but not limited to):
    How do digital research methods fit in a variety of HASS disciplines?
    How receptive are established scholars in those disciplines to new methods?
    What did we all learn from this experience?
    Was the additional burden worth it for our fellows - were their research lives enriched or just made more complicated?

  description: The goal of this course is to provide introductory training in spatial data processing, visualization, and mapping using R. The course focuses on a small set of popular packages for these tasks, many of which are drawn from a collection of packages called tidyverse. We will explain the new capabilities of packages terra and sf, why they should be used instead of other alternatives such as raster and sp,  and how packages with strong dependencies on rgdal, rgeos and maptools (recently archived on CRAN) must be either upgraded to use sf, terra or other alternatives.  We'll also create some graphs to summarize the data and explore options for map generation.

  description: "The Australian Reference Genome Atlas (ARGA) is a recently launched online platform for genomic data discovery across non-human, eukaryotic organisms. It indexes and aggregates data from a range of repositories, including NCBI GenBank, Barcode of Life Data system (BOLD) and Bioplatforms Australia's data portal, enabling users to search across multiple sources from a centralised portal. Where possible, genomic data are intersected with specimen information available from formalised collections (e.g. museums, herbaria) to supplement relevant metadata.\n\nThis workshop will feature a demo of the ARGA platform, giving an overview of its uses and allowing time for questions and discussions. The workshop will cover how ARGA can help to: \n - visualise and explore geographic occurrences of specimens (both with and without derived sequence data)\n - investigate the metadata available for each step in the chain of events between specimen collection and data deposition to help assess and compare sequences\n - discover genomic data for species according to thematic, ecological or trait groupings, such as threatened species, crop wild relatives, or poisonous and venomous species\n - determine summary statistics for genomic data availability across taxonomic clades or in thematic groupings (e.g. proportion of frog species with genome assemblies available, proportion of threatened Australian species with any available genomic data)"

  description: "Networking is an important aspect for the career development of PhDs - both to create collaborations and find future job opportunities. However, it is a softskill not thought in university courses. I facilitate guided networking sessions for organisations and think it will benefit PhDs greatly too. The participants will practise \"openness, kindness and honesty\" through a series of guided discussions around the following topics: \n- using meaningful questions to guide small groups of participants to get to know each other \n- facilitate groups to share their challenges and help each other with their challenges\n- Determine their own values \n- Use their values to revisit their challenges \n- Reflecting on networking experience and their learnings"

  description: |-
    The UQ R User Group (UQRUG) is a gathering for R users of all skills, to help each other solve problems, to share resources and tips, and to simply hang out with a nice community.

    Our main purpose is to serve as a drop-in help session for help with R and RStudio, but to keep things interesting we will briefly highlight a useful tool, function or package each week.

    In this special ResBaz edition of UQRUG we will be looking at some Cool but Useless ways we can use R. Coding and acaedmia can get stuffy and work focused, so this month we're going to play with some more entertaining R packages, which can hopefully make the learning process a bit more interesting.

  description: Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) research data plays a crucial role in advancing our comprehension of culture, society, and human well-being. In 2020, the HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons (HASS and I RDC) Program was established with the objective of establishing a comprehensive digital research infrastructure for HASS and Indigenous researchers and communities. Key strands of the HASS&I RDC that have been developed to date include:  * Language Data Commons of Australia,  * Integrated Research Infrastructure for Social Sciences,  * Improving Indigenous Research Capabilities, * Community Data Lab. This interconnected network of people, data resources, and research tools is bound together by shared technical standards, distributed technical systems, deliberate governance frameworks, open-source tools, and extensive training provisions. It is essential to emphasize that the program is firmly committed to Indigenous data governance and sovereignty, which underpin its fundamental principles. This presentation will anthropomorphise the condition of digital HASS data to highlight the individuals, families and cultural groups represented within ‘people’ data. The audience will gain insights into the challenges associated with reclaiming cultural heritage, achieved through rigorous exploration of Aboriginal languages, stories, art, and identity. Additionally, we will explore the recontextualization of historic research within a contemporary framework.

  description: There are many reasons a researcher should think about the commercialisation of their research, from tangibly solving the world's biggest problems, to creating more industry engagement and increasing funding opportunities in the future. Join Rachel in this session to discover the many reasons why research commercialisation matters, and explore the pathways to commercialise research. This is basically a crash course in research commercialisation mixed with a dash of personal reflections from Rachel’s entrepreneurship and research commercialisation experience so far. The goal of this session is for you to walk away feeling inspired and encouraged and hopefully thinking about how your research can be commercialised.

  description: Video-based learning is built upon Mayer’s multimedia theory of learning, which emphasises the value of flexible communication skills to lower the burden of cognitive load for diverse audiences.  Online multimedia can be leveraged for science communication, but the production of high-quality online resources has significant resource implications.  This project evaluated large undergraduate science courses that embedded over 100 hours of video content from 2020-2022 to determine best-practice guidelines for producing effective online multimedia.  Participant survey and interview results revealed broad agreement with the value of segmenting information, presenter presence, and mixed perspectives in science videos.  However individual student preferences varied on the extent of presenters’ on-screen visibility, use of graphics, and subtitling.  Video analytics revealed a decrease in viewer retention as each video progresses, but this rate of decline can be slowed through on-screen text, animations, and camera angle changes. Together this data provides an evidence-based framework for designing science videos that will engage different online audiences and disseminate your research.

  description: Researchers are expected to know their field inside out and be on top of the application domains the research they are doing can benefit. This requirement can be a challenging endeavour at the best of times, but has become extraordinarily chaotic in light of the pace of recent developments in the digital domain, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence, and their increasingly wide reaching consequences. How is our way of doing research being disrupted, both positively and negatively? Are the things we’re researching even relevant anymore, given the rapid change in the application domains where that research might be used? Questions like these can make even the most self-assured researcher doubt their path forwards. A sensible action to take in such circumstances is to ask experienced peers for advice, but what was “sensible” and valid advice even five years ago isn’t necessarily good advice today. In my talk, I’ll present insights and advice, both good and bad, for how to successfully navigate current changes, drawing upon my experiences advising industry, government and research sectors.
