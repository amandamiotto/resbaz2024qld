  description: This workshop aims to raise awareness of the potential for AI to accelerate and enhance research outputs for the current research milieu. AI is now a fact of life for research and is being increasingly used by students at both undergraduate and post graduate level. This workshop  will cover the newest developments in AI and introduce what AI means for research and how researchers can be prepared for it. The workshop will also cover what researchers need to ask for from research infrastructure at their institution. We will try to present a balanced view of both sides of the arguments for and against the use of AI in research. The format will be informal and will encourage discussion.

  description: This workshop aims to demonstrate how a small open LLM can be run locally to automate small, simple tasks locally without the need to use of commercial models. This is a very recent development in the AI space and therefore might be considered an advanced topic for many users. The workshop will assume some intermediate level of coding and will be based in notebooks for ease of hardware specs. The workshop will cover the basic set up and a discussion of the types of models that will work and where to acquire them. Then a simple workflow will be described. Attendees may bring their own data and the notebooks can be provided as long as the attendee can confidently use them on their hardware and coding environment.

  description: Programmers are advised to debug their code by explaining it, line by line, to a rubber duck*. In fact, one of the best ways to troubleshoot your data/research/programming woes is to talk about them. User groups - i.e., communities of practice - offer a collaborative space for researchers to share, discuss and learn about the tools they use. Join us for a live user group - all programming languages welcome! Most of the session will be a drop-in space for any data/programming questions you have (we're teaming up with UQ's usual Python User Group) but we'll also include a discussion on how user groups work, what they take and approaches for starting them.<br>*Hunt, Andrew; Thomas, David (1999).

  description: <p>Make your code go fast, fast - practical performance engineering for research software.</p><p>Whether you're running massively-parallel computer simulations or processing huge amounts of research data, research software across all domains increasingly requires the use of large-scale data and computational resources. As a result, it's becoming increasingly important to be able to write fast, well-optimised code to ensure efficient use of computational resources such as high-performance computing clusters, as well as improved turnaround time on research outcomes. Simply put, time spent waiting for code to run is time not spent doing research.</p><p>Squeezing every available bit of performance out of your code can be extremely time-consuming, but fortunately you can go a long way with just a little bit of programming know-how applied in the right places. This talk will provide an introduction to performance engineering, with a focus on practical, well-tested techniques for both compute- and data-heavy workflows. I will discuss methodologies and open-source tools which will help you get the most "bang for your buck" when optimising slow code in your research pipelines.</p>
