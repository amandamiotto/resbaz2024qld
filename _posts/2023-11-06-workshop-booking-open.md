### ResBaz workshop bookings are open

Once you have registered for ResBaz, you need to book into the workshops of your choice. 
All workshop bookings are **free of charge**, but most have limited capacity so we can 
only let you into that workshop if you have booked a place.

Decide on your [schedule](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2023qld/schedule/), then click
the links below to go to the relevant booking pages. You will need to have your **ResBaz
order number** handy when booking - this is just below the QR code in your ResBaz
registration confirmation email.
